It'll help you write media queries the easy way, plus other interesting functions to make you more productive coding css.

## Media query :computer:

### .below and .above :arrow_up_down:

You can only send a special letter that we reserve with fixed values that we consider appropriate for each modality.                  
.below will use the value of the last letter and set it to a max-width.                      
The .above will set in min-width  

Variables
```less
 @xs: 400px;                                     
 @m: 800px;                                      
 @l: 1050px;                                     
 @xl: 1800px;                                    
 @hd: 2200px;                                    
```

Detail, you do not pass the letter with the '@' the treatment is done by us.

    yourstyle                               
  });

  }                                             
} 
```

### .mobile, .tablet, .desktop, .hd 

We've prepared some media query ranges that we think are right for you.
You can use one of the functions, only parameter is your style, so you can use our ranges.

Example
```less
.yourclass {
  .mobile ({
    yourstyle
  });
 }     
```
Result
```css
.yourclass {
  @media only screen and (min-width: 400px) {
    yourstyle  
  }                                             
}
```
Example
```less
.yourclass {
  .tablet ({
    yourstyle
  });
}
```
Result
```css
.yourclass {
  @media only screen and
    (min-width: 400px) and (max-width: 800px) {
       yourstyle                                   
     }                                             
  }  
```
Example
```less
.yourclass {
  .desktop ({                                   
    yourstyle                                  
  });                                         
}   
```
Result
```css
.yourclass {                                    
  @media only screen and                        
   (min-width: 800px) and (max-width: 1050px) {   
      yourstyle                                   
    }                                             
}
```
## Utils :space_invader:

We have here some functions that can help you to coding faster

### .size

You can set properties like width and height in an easy way with .size, just pass the values, we will put them for you.              
You must follow the order of the parameters, first the width after the height   

Example
```less
.yourclass {                                    
  .size(200px, 150px);                         
}        
```

```css
.yourclass {                                    
  width: 200px;                                 
  height: 150px;                                
}
```

### .fontsize2em

Convert px into 'em' easily, just pass the number to function as it returns the font size property with last number converted to 'em' the context is set to a default value for the body, but you can modify it the way you prefer.
